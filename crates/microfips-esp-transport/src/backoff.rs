//! L2CAP connection exponential backoff.
//!
//! Ported from fips src/transport/ble/backoff.rs — adapted for no_std/ESP32:
//! - No HashMap (single peer, use Option<Entry>)
//! - No std::time::Instant (use embassy_time::Instant)
//! - No BleAddr (ESP32 only talks to one FIPS daemon)
//!
//! Tracks consecutive connection failures and applies exponential backoff
//! to prevent hammering an unreachable BLE peer. After MAX_FAILURES rapid
//! failures, the peer is "denied" (1-hour blacklist).
//!
//! The "healthy threshold" (30s) prevents long-lived connections from
//! incrementing the failure count — only connections that drop within
//! the first 30s count as failures.
