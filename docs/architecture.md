# Architecture

## Overview

microfips is a minimal FIPS leaf node on STM32F469I-DISCO and ESP32-D0WD. Both firmware
targets use `microfips-protocol::Node` for handshake, framing, heartbeats, and dual FSP
session handling. Above that runtime, `microfips-service` provides a compact request/
response boundary that downstream apps can reuse without depending on HTTP.

Both MCUs connect to a VPS running stock FIPS through host-side bridges that translate
length-prefixed serial or BLE frames into UDP. The ESP32 can also connect directly to a
local FIPS daemon via BLE L2CAP, with no bridge or UDP hop at all. HTTP remains optional
and lives in the demo-only `microfips-http-demo` crate.
- **STM32F469I-DISCO:** USB CDC ACM transport (embassy-usb, 64B packets)
- **ESP32-D0WD:** UART transport (CP210x USB-serial, 115200 baud), BLE GATT transport (`--features ble`), or BLE L2CAP direct transport (`--features l2cap`)

```

The original plan used SLIP + IPv6 + smoltcp for IP tunneling. This was abandoned
because the MCU is leaf-only (no routing, no transit, no discovery), and
length-prefixed frames over CDC are simpler and sufficient for single-peer
communication.

## Service boundary

```
+---------------------------+

+---------------------------+
|  microfips-service        |  request/response router + adapter

+---------------------------+
|  microfips-core           |  Noise, FMP, FSP, identity
+---------------------------+
```

`microfips-service` is transport-agnostic and HTTP-free. Optional HTTP demos layer on top
in `microfips-http-demo`, while binaries such as STM32, ESP32, and the simulator remain
thin composition roots.

## Transport: MCU <-> Host <-> VPS

### STM32F469 (USB CDC)

```
   STM32F469I-DISCO          Host (Linux)               VPS
   +----------------+    +-------------------+    +------------------+
   | microfips fw   |    | serial_udp_bridge |    | FIPS daemon      |
   | FIPS protocol  |CDC | UDP <-> serial    |UDP | :2121            |
   | + service app  |<-->| auto-detect MCU   |<-->| forwards peers   |
   +----------------+    +-------------------+    +------------------+
```

### ESP32-D0WD (UART / BLE)

```
   ESP32-D0WD              Host (Linux)               VPS
   +----------------+    +-------------------+    +------------------+
   | microfips-esp32|    | serial_udp_bridge |    | FIPS daemon      |
   | Node + service |UART| or ble_udp_bridge |UDP | :2121            |
   | dual FSP mode  |/BLE|                   |<-->| forwards peers   |
   +----------------+    +-------------------+    +------------------+
```

The current bridge layout is single-hop: the host bridge sends UDP directly to FIPS.
There is no SSH tunnel or VPS-side bridge in the normal path anymore.

### ESP32-D0WD (BLE L2CAP direct)

```
   ESP32-D0WD (L2CAP)          FIPS daemon (local)
   +----------------+           +------------------+
   | microfips-esp32|           | FIPS daemon      |
   | Node + service |BLE        | :2121            |
   | dual FSP mode  |L2CAP      | forwards peers   |
   +----------------+<---->     +------------------+
                           PSM 0x0085
```

The L2CAP path skips the host bridge and UDP entirely. The ESP32 connects over BLE
L2CAP Connection-Oriented Channels directly to a FIPS daemon on the same host or LAN.

**Role arbitration:** The ESP32 builds both a BLE central and peripheral. It advertises
as peripheral for 3 seconds (bounded window), then falls back to scanning as central.
If a FIPS peer connects during the peripheral window, the ESP32 accepts the inbound
L2CAP channel. If no peer is found, the ESP32 scans for the FIPS service UUID and
initiates an outbound L2CAP connection as central.

**Readiness contract:** Protocol startup is gated on a single signal (`L2CAP_READY_SIG`)
that carries the peer's 33-byte compressed public key. The signal fires only after both
the L2CAP channel (accept or create) and the pre-handshake pubkey exchange are complete.
The `L2capTransport` holds the peer pubkey as instance state, so the protocol layer
never starts before the peer identity is available.

**Pre-handshake pubkey exchange:** After the L2CAP channel opens, both sides exchange
33-byte messages: `[0x00][32B x-only secp256k1 pubkey]`. The leading `0x00` prefix
byte distinguishes this from FMP frames. Each side has a 5-second timeout for the
exchange. Once complete, `L2CAP_READY_SIG` fires and the Noise IK handshake begins
over the same channel.

**Framing difference:** L2CAP CoC with SeqPacket semantics preserves message boundaries,
so raw FMP frames are sent without the 2-byte LE length prefix used by serial transports.
The framing layer in the L2CAP variant passes frames through directly.

### Startup sequence

1. MCU boots and waits for host-side transport readiness
2. Host bridge opens UART/BLE/USB CDC transport
3. Bridge forwards length-prefixed frames as UDP to FIPS
4. FIPS replies over UDP to the same bridge

### Serial framing

All data over CDC ACM uses length-prefixed frames:
```
[2 bytes: payload_len LE] [payload_len bytes: payload]
```

Parsed by `recv_frame()` on the MCU and by `fips_bridge.py` on the host/VPS.
USB bulk transfers use 64-byte max packet size. A zero-length packet (ZLP) is
sent after any transfer whose length is an exact multiple of 64 bytes.

## FIPS Protocol (FMP Layer)

### FMP Frame Format

```
[4 bytes: prefix] [variable: payload]
Prefix: [version:4bits | phase:4bits] [flags:8] [payload_len:16 LE]
```

### FMP Message Types

| Phase | Name        | Wire Size | Contents                                      |
|-------|-------------|-----------|-----------------------------------------------|
| 0x01  | MSG1        | 114 B     | prefix(4) + sender_idx(4) + noise(106)        |
| 0x02  | MSG2        | 69 B      | prefix(4) + sender(4) + receiver(4) + noise(57) |
| 0x00  | ESTABLISHED | variable  | prefix(4) + receiver_idx(4) + counter(8) + encrypted |

### Noise IK Handshake

Pattern: `Noise_IK_secp256k1_ChaChaPoly_SHA256`

```
  <- s                    (pre-message: responder's static key, parity-normalized)
  -> e, es, s, ss         (msg1: 106 bytes = 33 + 49 + 24)
  <- e, ee, se            (msg2: 57 bytes = 33 + 24)
```

#### FIPS Deviation: Empty AAD during handshake

The Noise spec says `EncryptAndHash(pt)` should use `h` (hash state) as AAD.
FIPS passes empty AAD (`&[]`). We match FIPS.

#### `se` Token — NOT a Deviation

Earlier analysis claimed FIPS deviated on the `se` DH. This was incorrect.
The Noise spec says `se = DH(s_init, re_resp)` and `se = DH(e_resp, rs_init)`.
These are the same because ECDH is commutative. Our implementation's
`read_message2()` computes `se = DH(e_init, rs_resp)` which is the same as the
`es` token. Both sides agree, so keys match.

#### Transport Key Derivation: `finalize()` / `split()`

**Critical fix (2026-03-27):** Our `finalize()` originally used two HKDF calls
(`mix_key(ck, [0;32])` then `mix_key(ck, k1)`), but FIPS's `split()` does a single
`HKDF-SHA256(ck, &[])` expanding to 64 bytes, split into k1 (send) and k2 (recv).

```rust
// Correct implementation matching FIPS:
pub fn finalize(&self) -> ([u8; 32], [u8; 32]) {
    let hk = Hkdf::<Sha256>::new(Some(&self.ck), &[]);  // empty IKM
    let mut okm = [0u8; 64];
    hk.expand(&[], &mut okm).unwrap();
    let mut k1 = [0u8; 32]; k1.copy_from_slice(&okm[..32]);
    let mut k2 = [0u8; 32]; k2.copy_from_slice(&okm[32..]);
    (k1, k2)  // (k_send, k_recv) for initiator
}
```

### Established Messages

After handshake, both sides derive `k_send` and `k_recv`. Messages use:
```
AEAD(key, nonce=counter, aad=outer_header, plaintext=inner)
```
- `outer_header` = first 16 bytes of FMP frame (`prefix(4) + receiver_idx(4) + counter(8)`)
- `counter` = 8-byte LE nonce from the ESTABLISHED header (NOT a local counter)
- `inner` = [timestamp:4 LE] [msg_type:1] [payload:variable]

The `counter` in the ESTABLISHED header IS the AEAD nonce. The receiver uses the
counter from the incoming header, not a local counter. FIPS does an O(1) session
lookup using `receiver_idx`, so the heartbeat must include FIPS's index.

| Type       | Value | Description                          |
|------------|-------|--------------------------------------|
| HEARTBEAT  | 0x51  | Keep-alive, sent every 10 seconds    |
| DISCONNECT | 0x50  | Peer disconnect notification         |
| SESSION_DATAGRAM | 0x00 | FSP session data                |

## What's Proven

### Protocol (169 tests: 90 core + 21 error injection + 22 compatibility + 17 wire format + 13 FSP edge cases + 6 FSP integration + 46 protocol)

- Noise IK full handshake simulation (initiator + test responder)
- FMP MSG1/MSG2/ESTABLISHED build and parse roundtrips
- AEAD encrypt/decrypt with correct and wrong keys/nonce/AAD
- ECDH keypair derivation, SLIP encode/decode, identity derivation
- `finalize()` / `split()` produces correct transport keys matching FIPS
- FSP session protocol (XK handshake + encrypted data transfer)
- FSP edge cases: invalid state transitions, duplicate session IDs, truncated frames

### Sim-to-VPS (microfips-sim, host-side)

- `microfips-sim --listen 45679` completes Noise IK handshake with live VPS
- ESTABLISHED messages decrypt correctly (counter from header, not local counter)
- Sustained heartbeat exchange for 70+ seconds with no FIPS timeout
- Non-ESTABLISHED messages from other peers are ignored gracefully

### Host-to-VPS (microfips-link, raw UDP)

- `microfips-link` completes Noise IK handshake with live VPS over UDP
- VPS responds with MSG2 containing valid Noise payload
- VPS accepts MCU identity and promotes to active peer
- Transport keys derived correctly

### USB (hardware)

- CDC enumeration (device appears as `c0de:cafe` on `/dev/ttyACM*`)
- Bidirectional CDC echo (verified with multiple packet sizes)
- ZLP handling for 64-byte-aligned transfers

### Bridge-on-VPS architecture

- Bridge receives MSG1 from MCU via SSH tunnel, forwards to VPS FIPS via UDP
- Bridge receives MSG2 from VPS FIPS, writes to tunnel → proxy → MCU
- Full exchange confirmed: `CDC->UDP: 114B` (MSG1) and `UDP->CDC: 69B` (MSG2)
- Sim heartbeat exchange confirmed through bridge: 7 heartbeats sent, 22 ESTABLISHED received

### ESP32 BLE L2CAP direct transport

- ESP32 connects directly to local FIPS daemon via BLE L2CAP CoC (PSM 0x0085)
- No Python bridge, no UDP hop in the data path
- Full Noise IK handshake + sustained heartbeats over L2CAP
- Role arbitration: peripheral advertise (3s) then central scan fallback
- Pre-handshake pubkey exchange with 5-second timeout
- Raw FMP frames (no length prefix) over L2CAP SeqPacket

### Dual-MCU simultaneous handshake

- Both STM32 and ESP32 sustain VPS heartbeat round-trips concurrently
- MCU-to-MCU FSP PING/PONG through FIPS proven on hardware (STM32 to ESP32 and back)

## Known Issues and Risks

### 1. RNG quality for ephemeral keys

The STM32F469 hardware RNG generates ephemeral keys for each handshake. We don't
currently check for RNG seed errors or health status. Should verify RNG produces
different keys across handshakes.

### 2. Nonce counter wrap

`SEND_COUNTER` is u32, wraps at 2^32. At one message per 10s (heartbeat), wrap
occurs after ~136 years. Not practical concern unless high-rate data transfer is
added.

### 3. FIPS protocol version compatibility

Our FMP uses version 0 against FIPS v0.3.0-dev. Future FIPS updates may change
the wire format.

### 4. Other peers' data arrives through bridge

When the MCU is connected, the bridge also forwards UDP from other peers trying to
reach FIPS. The sim receives MSG1 from other peers during steady state — these
must be ignored (sim handles this; MCU firmware also ignores non-ESTABLISHED).

## Host-Side Simulator

`microfips-sim` is a host-side crate that simulates the MCU's full FIPS lifecycle
without hardware. It uses the same `microfips-core` protocol code as the firmware
and speaks length-prefixed framing over TCP or stdin/stdout.

Modes:
- `microfips-sim --listen PORT` — TCP server mode (preferred for bridge testing)
- `microfips-sim tcp_addr` — TCP client mode
- `microfips-sim` — stdin/stdout mode (for socat piping)

This enables:
- Fast iteration: `cargo run -p microfips-sim` vs build/flash/wait cycle
- VPS integration testing without hardware
- Proven working: sustained heartbeat exchange for 70+ seconds against live VPS

## Clock Configuration

```
HSI (16 MHz) → PLL → 168 MHz sysclk
                   → 48 MHz USB (PLL_Q, Clk48sel)
                   → 42 MHz APB1
                   → 84 MHz APB2
```

HSE bypass hangs on this board. Do NOT use HSE.
