# HIERARCHY ROLE: SUB-PROJECT MANAGER

You are the isolated manager of balloon-fips only. You report to the balloon-hermes orchestrator group.

## CRITICAL BOUNDARIES (ANTI-COLLAPSE GUARDRAILS)

- You are a SUB-MANAGER, not a coordinator. You do NOT coordinate other balloon tracks.
- You have ZERO visibility into other tracks' kanban boards, status, or plans.
- You are FORBIDDEN from: maintaining cross-track plans, building dependency graphs, reading other tracks' assessments, nudging other tracks, or acting as an orchestrator.
- Your ONLY external duty is: provide status reports to balloon-hermes when asked, using the STATUS-REQUEST-PROMPT.md template.
- Do NOT read ~/repos/balloon-fresh/docs/coordination/ files (INDEX.md, DECISIONS-AND-BLOCKERS.md, COORDINATOR-TRACKING.md, TRACKS-REGISTRY.yaml) — those are orchestrator-only files.
- Do NOT read ~/.hermes/profiles/manager/state/session-notes.md — that contains coordinator context.

## YOUR SCOPE
- Your worktree: this directory only
- Your kanban: your board only (if configured)
- Your assessment: docs/INTEGRATION-ASSESSMENT.md in this worktree
- Your status file: docs/STATUS-balloon-fips.md in this worktree

## DELEGATION EXPECTATIONS (POSITIVE COLLABORATION)

You are part of a hierarchy. The orchestrator (balloon-hermes group) DELEGATES work to you. Your responsibilities:

1. **EXPECT DELEGATION.** When the orchestrator sends you a task, it is YOUR responsibility. Execute it, do not bounce it back. The orchestrator chose you because this is your domain expertise.
2. **RESPOND PROMPTLY.** When asked for status or a task update, respond in the SAME turn. Use the STATUS-REQUEST-PROMPT.md template if one was sent.
3. **PROACTIVELY REPORT cross-track findings.** If you discover something relevant to another track's domain (e.g., a hardware issue, a protocol mismatch, a shared resource conflict), tell the orchestrator: "ORCHESTRATOR: Forward this to [track-name]: [finding]". The orchestrator routes it — you do NOT contact other tracks directly.
4. **SHARE BLOCKERS EARLY.** If you are blocked on something another track owns (shared hardware, dependency, protocol), tell the orchestrator immediately. Do NOT silently wait or try to work around it yourself.
5. **YOUR STATUS IS VISIBILITY.** Commit and push regularly. The orchestrator monitors your worktree via session_search and git log. Uncommitted work is invisible work.

These complement your anti-collapse guardrails above: you collaborate THROUGH the orchestrator, never directly with other tracks.

When the orchestrator (balloon-hermes) asks for a status update, fill the template from STATUS-REQUEST-PROMPT.md and reply with the filled template only. No commentary, no cross-track opinions.

# microfips — Agent Reference

## Project

Minimal FIPS (Free Internetworking Peering System) leaf node on STM32F469I-DISCO and ESP32.
Both MCUs use length-prefixed framing → host bridge → UDP → VPS running stock FIPS.
- **STM32F469I-DISCO:** USB CDC ACM transport → serial_udp_bridge.py (primary target)
- **STM32F746G-DISCO:** USB CDC ACM transport → serial_udp_bridge.py (tested, hardware-verified 2026-05-04: FIPS Noise IK handshake + heartbeat with VPS passes. Separate build target `--features board-f746`. Only 1 user LED on PI1; orange/red/blue pins are Arduino header GPIOs with no physical LEDs.)
- **ESP32-D0WD:** UART transport (CP210x USB-serial) → serial_udp_bridge.py, OR BLE transport → ble_udp_bridge.py (feature-gated), OR WiFi transport → direct UDP to FIPS (feature-gated, requires external antenna)

## Workspace architecture

- `microfips-core`: cryptographic/session primitives, FIPS compat constants (auto-generated)
- `microfips-protocol`: `Node`, framing, transport trait, FSP runtime, `ScriptedPeer` test harness
- `microfips-service`: transport-neutral request/response layer above protocol
- `microfips-http-demo`: optional demo-only HTTP adapter and demo service
- `microfips-esp-transport`: shared ESP32 transport code (runner, LED, RNG, handlers, WiFi config)
- `microfips-esp-common`: chip-agnostic ESP32 code (DNS, config, stats, UDP transport)

STM32, ESP32, simulator, and host demo binaries are composition roots over those layers.
ESP32 D0WD and S3 share a `runner` module (`run_node()`, `make_led()`, `init_trng()`)
from `microfips-esp-transport`; only WiFi stays per-chip due to TRNG borrow constraints.
BLE is feature-gated transport plumbing, not a separate protocol stack.

## VPS Access

VPS credentials are stored in environment variables (or a `.env` file, never committed):

```bash
export VPS_HOST=orangeclaw.dns4sats.xyz
export VPS_USER=routstr
export VPS_PASS=<password>

# Shorthand:
vssh() { sshpass -p "$VPS_PASS" ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no "$VPS_USER@$VPS_HOST" "$@"; }
vscp() { sshpass -p "$VPS_PASS" scp -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no "$1" "$VPS_USER@$VPS_HOST:$2"; }
```

VPS FIPS binds `0.0.0.0:2121`, MCU peers configured at `127.0.0.1:31337` (STM32) and `127.0.0.1:31338` (ESP32).
FIPS logs: `vssh "echo $VPS_PASS | sudo -S journalctl -u fips --no-pager -n 30 --since '5 min ago'"`

## Build

### STM32F469

```bash
cargo build -p microfips --release --target thumbv7em-none-eabi
# Output: target/thumbv7em-none-eabi/release/microfips
```

### STM32F746

```bash
cargo build -p microfips --release --target thumbv7em-none-eabi --no-default-features --features board-f746
# Output: target/thumbv7em-none-eabi/release/microfips
```

Same firmware crate, different `board-*` feature. The default build targets F469.

### ESP32-D0WD

Requires the Espressif Rust toolchain (installed via `espup`, activated with `RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN=esp`):

```bash
. /home/ubuntu/export-esp.sh && RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN=esp cargo build -p microfips-esp32 --release --target xtensa-esp32-none-elf -Zbuild-std=core,alloc
# Output: target/xtensa-esp32-none-elf/release/microfips-esp32
```

### ESP32-D0WD (BLE variant)

Same toolchain. Feature flag `ble` enables BLE transport instead of UART:

```bash
. /home/ubuntu/export-esp.sh && RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN=esp cargo build -p microfips-esp32 --release --target xtensa-esp32-none-elf -Zbuild-std=core,alloc --features ble
# Output: target/xtensa-esp32-none-elf/release/microfips-esp32-ble
```

Default build (no `--features ble`) produces UART transport firmware. The BLE variant uses
UART0 for structured logging (`log` crate) and control interface instead of FIPS traffic.

Each variant outputs to its own binary — no build order dependency between variants.

### ESP32 (WiFi variant)

Requires an ESP32 variant with WiFi hardware and an external antenna (e.g. ESP32-S3,
ESP32-WROOM-32, ESP32-D0WD). Feature flag `wifi`
enables WiFi transport instead of UART:

```bash
# Set credentials in .env (gitignored, never committed):
#   WIFI_SSID=MyNetwork
#   WIFI_PASSWORD=MyPass
export $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs) \
  && . /home/ubuntu/export-esp.sh && RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN=esp cargo build -p microfips-esp32 --release --target xtensa-esp32-none-elf -Zbuild-std=core,alloc --features wifi
# Output: target/xtensa-esp32-none-elf/release/microfips-esp32-wifi
```

The ESP32-D0WD has WiFi hardware (802.11 b/g/n). However, WiFi requires an
external antenna — most D0WD dev boards include one, but verify before use. Credentials
are set via `WIFI_SSID` and `WIFI_PASSWORD` env vars at build time (from `.env`).
No secrets in source.

## Flash and Run

### CRITICAL: Do NOT use probe-rs during USB testing (STM32)

probe-rs halts the CPU periodically for RTT reads. When the CPU is halted mid-USB-transfer,
the USB connection drops. This manifests as device disappearing from lsusb, /dev/ttyACM*
not appearing, and corrupted register reads (EPENA stuck, EPTYP wrong).

This was misdiagnosed as an embassy USB bug (PR #5738, since closed). The real root cause
is probe-rs + USB coexistence. A completely separate firmware using usb-device (NOT embassy)
also fails enumeration with probe-rs attached.

**Correct deployment: use st-flash, then test via pyserial.**

```bash
# Flash
arm-none-eabi-objcopy -O binary target/thumbv7em-none-eabi/release/microfips microfips.bin
st-flash --connect-under-reset write microfips.bin 0x08000000

# Reset
st-flash --connect-under-reset reset
```

### USB OTG FS PHY reset (automatic)

The firmware performs an explicit USB PHY reset after `embassy_stm32::init()` to ensure
reliable re-enumeration after `st-flash` soft resets (SYSRESETREQ without NRST). Without
this, the USB PHY can retain stale state and the device won't appear as `/dev/ttyACM*`.

No manual RESET button press is needed after flashing.

### When probe-rs IS acceptable

- Initial bringup (no USB active yet)
- Reading/writing flash option bytes (carefully — see warnings below)
- `probe-rs download --chip STM32F469NIHx --connect-under-reset` (flashing only, then detach immediately)

### defmt_rtt breaks USB CDC (confirmed cross-project)

`defmt_rtt` (even when unused via `use defmt_rtt as _`) prevents USB OTG FS enumeration on this board. Root cause unknown — possibly SWD/ITM resource contention. This is distinct from the probe-rs issue above; even with `st-flash` and no probe-rs attached, `defmt_rtt` in the binary prevents enumeration.

**Evidence**: Confirmed in gm65-scanner project via controlled A/B test on identical firmware — same code with `defmt_rtt` removed enumerates, with it present does not. The BSP's HAL unconditionally compiles with `defmt` feature enabled.

**Current microfips status**: `use defmt_rtt as _;` is imported in `crates/microfips/src/main.rs:7`. The firmware appears to work with USB CDC based on test procedures, but no `defmt!` macros are actually called. If USB issues arise, try building without `defmt_rtt` and `panic_probe`.

### SWD recovery when USB is active (STM32)

```bash
st-flash --connect-under-reset reset
```

### ESP32 BLE Transport

The ESP32 firmware supports BLE as an alternative to UART serial. Feature-gated behind
`--features ble`. When active, UART0 is repurposed for `esp_println!` debug output instead
of FIPS traffic.

**BLE stack:** trouble v0.6.0 + esp-radio v0.17.0 (pure Rust, no_std, Embassy-native)
**Host bridge:** `tools/ble_udp_bridge.py` using `bleak` (Python async BLE library)

**GATT service UUIDs (firmware ↔ bridge must match):**

| Characteristic | UUID | Direction |
|---------------|------|-----------|
| Service | `6f696670-7300-4265-8001-000000000001` | — |
| RX (write) | `6f696670-7300-4265-8002-000000000002` | Host → ESP32 |
| TX (notify) | `6f696670-7300-4265-8003-000000000003` | ESP32 → Host |

**Build BLE firmware:**
```bash
. /home/ubuntu/export-esp.sh && RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN=esp cargo build -p microfips-esp32 --release --target xtensa-esp32-none-elf -Zbuild-std=core,alloc --features ble
```

**Flash:**
```bash
kill $(fuser /dev/ttyUSB0 2>/dev/null) 2>/dev/null; sleep 1
. /home/ubuntu/export-esp.sh && RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN=esp espflash flash -p /dev/ttyUSB0 --chip esp32 target/xtensa-esp32-none-elf/release/microfips-esp32-ble
```

**Verify BLE advertising:**
```bash
python3 -c "
import asyncio
from bleak import BleakScanner
async def scan():
    devices = await BleakScanner.discover(timeout=10)
    found = [d for d in devices if d.name and 'microfips' in d.name.lower()]
    if found:
        print(f'Found: {found[0].name} ({found[0].address})')
    else:
        print('Not found')
asyncio.run(scan())
"
```

**Run BLE bridge to VPS:**
```bash
python3 tools/ble_udp_bridge.py --ble-name "microfips-esp32" --udp-host orangeclaw.dns4sats.xyz --verbose
```

**Expected:** `>> BLE->UDP: frame#1 114B` (MSG1), `<< UDP->BLE: frame#1 69B` (MSG2),
then heartbeat frames every ~10s.

**UART debug output:**
While BLE is active, UART0 outputs debug via `esp_println!`. Read with:
```bash
python3 -c "
import serial, time
s = serial.Serial('/dev/ttyUSB0', 115200, timeout=2)
deadline = time.time() + 20
while time.time() < deadline:
    line = s.readline().decode(errors='replace').strip()
    if line: print(line, flush=True)
s.close()
"
```

**Dependencies:**
```bash
pip install bleak
```

**Troubleshooting:**
- **No BLE device found in scan:** ESP32 may still be booting (wait 10s, retry). Check BLE adapter: `hciconfig hci0` (must show UP RUNNING).
- **Bridge connects but no frames:** Check UART debug output for errors. Verify VPS is reachable.
- **Bridge can't open serial for debug:** BLE bridge uses D-Bus/BlueZ, not the serial port. They can coexist.
- **Default UART build broken after BLE work:** Both builds are tested. Run `cargo clean` if Cargo feature cache causes issues.

### ESP32 L2CAP Transport

The ESP32 firmware can connect directly to a local FIPS daemon via BLE L2CAP
Connection-Oriented Channels (CoC). No Python bridge, no UDP hop. Feature-gated
behind `--features l2cap`. When active, UART0 is repurposed for structured logging
(`log` crate) and control interface instead of FIPS traffic.

**BLE stack:** trouble-host v0.6.0 + esp-radio v0.17.0 (pure Rust, no_std, Embassy-native)
Same stack as BLE GATT but uses L2CAP CoC API instead of GATT characteristics.

**L2CAP constants:**

| Item | Value |
|------|-------|
| PSM | `0x0085` (133 decimal) |
| FIPS Service UUID | `9c90b790-2cc5-42c0-9f87-c9cc40648f4c` |
| L2CAP MTU | 2048 bytes |
| PacketPool MTU | 2054 bytes (configured via `.cargo/config.toml`) |
| Pre-handshake format | `[0x00][32B x-only secp256k1 pubkey][1B capability flags]` (34B payload, 36B wire with framing) |
| Framing | 2-byte BE length prefix on all L2CAP frames, including pubkey exchange (matches FIPS `BluerStream` framing on all branches) |
| Capability byte | `0x3C` (CAN_CENTRAL \| CAN_PERIPHERAL \| L2CAP_SUPPORTED \| PREFER_L2CAP) |
| FRAME_CAP | 768 bytes (application-level frame buffer; MTU stays 2048) |
| BLE address | Random static (`02:00:00:00:00:FF`) — deterministic from `ESP32_NSEC[27..32]` + `0xFF` prefix, MSB-first |
| Advertising name | `microfips-l2cap` |

**Build L2CAP firmware:**
```bash
. /home/ubuntu/export-esp.sh && RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN=esp cargo build -p microfips-esp32 --release --target xtensa-esp32-none-elf -Zbuild-std=core,alloc --features l2cap
```

**Flash:**
```bash
kill $(fuser /dev/ttyUSB0 2>/dev/null) 2>/dev/null; sleep 1
. /home/ubuntu/export-esp.sh && RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN=esp espflash flash -p /dev/ttyUSB0 --chip esp32 target/xtensa-esp32-none-elf/release/microfips-esp32-l2cap
```

**Test procedure (local FIPS daemon, no VPS needed):**

1. Start local FIPS daemon with BLE:
   ```bash
   pkill -f "target/release/fips" 2>/dev/null; sleep 2
   RUST_LOG=debug /home/ubuntu/src2/fips/target/release/fips --config /tmp/fips-local-ble.yaml > /tmp/fips-local.log 2>&1 &
   ```

2. FIPS config for BLE transport:
   ```yaml
   transports:
     ble:
       adapter: hci0
   ```
   Role negotiation is handled via capability flags in the BLE pubkey exchange
   (FIPS commit `8c388cf`). No manual tiebreaker configuration needed.

3. Flash ESP32:
   ```bash
   kill $(fuser /dev/ttyUSB0 2>/dev/null) 2>/dev/null; sleep 1
   . /home/ubuntu/export-esp.sh && RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN=esp cargo build -p microfips-esp32 --release --target xtensa-esp32-none-elf -Zbuild-std=core,alloc --features l2cap
   . /home/ubuntu/export-esp.sh && RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN=esp espflash flash -p /dev/ttyUSB0 --chip esp32 target/xtensa-esp32-none-elf/release/microfips-esp32-l2cap
   ```

4. Wait 15s for BLE scan + connection, then check FIPS logs:
   ```bash
   tail -30 /tmp/fips-local.log
   ```

**Expected in FIPS log:** `BLE scanner: FIPS peer found`, `BLE connection established`,
`Sent msg2 response`, `Connection promoted to active peer`. No `bad prefix 0x01` errors.
Sustained heartbeats continue indefinitely after promotion.

**Connection modes:**

The ESP32 supports both central (scan + outbound connect) and peripheral (advertise +
accept) roles. Central role is attempted first (3s BLE scan for FIPS service UUID),
then falls back to peripheral advertising if no FIPS peer is found.

**UART debug output + control interface:**
While L2CAP or BLE is active, UART0 outputs structured logs via the `log` crate
(format: `[LEVEL module_path] message`, matching FIPS style). UART0 also accepts
line-delimited control commands. Read logs and send commands with:

```bash
# Read structured log output
python3 -c "
import serial, time
s = serial.Serial('/dev/ttyUSB0', 115200, timeout=2)
deadline = time.time() + 20
while time.time() < deadline:
    line = s.readline().decode(errors='replace').strip()
    if line: print(line, flush=True)
s.close()
"

# Send control commands (JSON responses)
python3 tools/test_control.py
```

**Control commands:**

| Command | Response | Description |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| `show_status` | JSON with node_addr, npub, state, uptime_secs, transport_type | Node overview |
| `show_peers` | JSON with peer's node_addr and pubkey | Peer info (error if no peer) |
| `show_stats` | JSON with msg1_tx, msg2_rx, hb_tx, hb_rx, data_tx, data_rx | Protocol counters |
| `help` | Plain text list of commands | Command reference |
| `version` | `microfips-esp32 <version>` | Firmware version |
| `reset` | JSON `{"status":"ok"}`, then reboot | Software reset via RTC_CNTL SW_SYS_RST |

Response format matches FIPS control protocol: `{"status":"ok","data":{...}}` or
`{"status":"error","message":"..."}`.

**Troubleshooting:**
- **No FIPS connection:** Check BLE adapter: `hciconfig hci0` (must show UP RUNNING).
  Restart FIPS daemon. Role negotiation is automatic via capability flags.
- **`bad prefix 0x01` in FIPS logs:** Stale L2CAP channels from previous connection.
  ESP32 drains channels on reconnect (fixed in commit `8ed21cb`).
- **`BLE probe connect timeout`:** Check BLE address type — FIPS must use `LeRandom` for
  ESP32's random static address (fixed in FIPS commit `9779672`).
- **Wrong firmware flashed:** Each variant has its own binary: `microfips-esp32` (UART),
  `microfips-esp32-ble` (BLE), `microfips-esp32-l2cap` (L2CAP). No build order dependency.
- **Tie-breaker deadlock:** Both sides try to be central simultaneously. Resolved via
  capability-based role negotiation (FIPS commit `8c388cf`). No manual config needed.

**Key differences from BLE GATT:**
- No Python bridge needed — ESP32 talks to FIPS daemon directly over BLE L2CAP
- No UDP hop — pure BLE L2CAP connection to local FIPS daemon
- No GATT characteristics — uses L2CAP CoC channel on PSM 0x0085
- 2-byte BE length prefix on all L2CAP frames (matches FIPS `BluerStream` framing — applies to pubkey exchange AND all subsequent data)

### ESP32 WiFi Transport

WiFi transport for ESP32 variants with WiFi hardware (e.g. ESP32-S3, ESP32-WROOM-32).
Feature-gated behind `--features wifi`, outputs `microfips-esp32-wifi` binary.

**Build:**
```bash
# Set credentials in .env (gitignored, never committed):
#   WIFI_SSID=MyNetwork
#   WIFI_PASSWORD=MyPass
export $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs) \
  && . /home/ubuntu/export-esp.sh && RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN=esp \
  cargo build -p microfips-esp32 --release --target xtensa-esp32-none-elf \
  -Zbuild-std=core,alloc --features wifi
```

Credentials are set via `WIFI_SSID` and `WIFI_PASSWORD` environment variables at build
time (from `.env`, which is gitignored). No secrets in source.

**Flash:**
```bash
kill $(fuser /dev/ttyUSB0 2>/dev/null) 2>/dev/null; sleep 1
. /home/ubuntu/export-esp.sh && RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN=esp espflash flash -p /dev/ttyUSB0 --chip esp32 \
  target/xtensa-esp32-none-elf/release/microfips-esp32-wifi
```

The ESP32-D0WD has WiFi hardware (802.11 b/g/n) but requires an external antenna.
Most dev boards include one. WiFi works on all standard ESP32 variants.

**Features:**
- WiFi STA via DHCP with 30s timeout (panic on failure)
- DNS A-record resolution for VPS hostname (manual UDP DNS query, no new deps)
- Raw framing mode for direct UDP to FIPS (`set_raw_framing(true)`)
- Mutually exclusive with `ble` and `l2cap` features
- Separate binary: `microfips-esp32-wifi` (UART/BLE/L2CAP use `microfips-esp32`)

**Architecture:**
- `wifi_transport.rs` — Transport trait impl over embassy-net UDP socket (shared via `microfips-esp-common`)
- `bin/wifi.rs` — WiFi composition-root binary
- Config: `WIFI_SSID`, `WIFI_PASSWORD` (env vars), `VPS_HOST`, `VPS_PORT`
- Retains `WifiController` for transport lifetime (prevents WiFi disconnect)
- Both D0WD and S3 use `WifiTransport` from `microfips-esp-common`

**Test:**
```bash
# Build
export $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs) \
  && . /home/ubuntu/export-esp.sh && RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN=esp \
  cargo build -p microfips-esp32 --release --target xtensa-esp32-none-elf \
  -Zbuild-std=core,alloc --features wifi

# Flash (D0WD via CP210x)
kill $(fuser /dev/ttyUSB0 2>/dev/null) 2>/dev/null; sleep 1
. /home/ubuntu/export-esp.sh && RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN=esp espflash flash -p /dev/ttyUSB0 --chip esp32 \
  target/xtensa-esp32-none-elf/release/microfips-esp32-wifi

# Monitor serial output
python3 -c "
import serial, time
s = serial.Serial('/dev/ttyUSB0', 115200, timeout=2)
deadline = time.time() + 45
while time.time() < deadline:
    line = s.readline().decode(errors='replace').strip()
    if line: print(line, flush=True)
s.close()
"
```

**Expected:** WiFi connects, DNS resolves VPS hostname, FIPS handshake (MSG1 sent,
MSG2 received), sustained heartbeats.

**Troubleshooting:**
- **WiFi doesn't connect:** Verify `WIFI_SSID` and `WIFI_PASSWORD` are correct at build time.
  The firmware panics after 30s DHCP timeout. Verify the target board has an external
  antenna connected.
- **DNS resolution fails:** The firmware uses manual UDP DNS queries (port 53). Ensure the
  WiFi network allows DNS to external resolvers. The VPS hostname must have an A record.
- **Handshake fails:** Verify VPS FIPS is running and reachable from the WiFi network. Check
  `VPS_HOST` and `VPS_PORT` config values.
- **Wrong firmware flashed:** Each variant has its own binary: `microfips-esp32` (UART),
  `microfips-esp32-ble` (BLE), `microfips-esp32-l2cap` (L2CAP), `microfips-esp32-wifi` (WiFi).
  No build order dependency.

### ESP32-S3 (TiLDAGON)

The ESP32-S3 TiLDAGON supports WiFi and BLE L2CAP transports via `microfips-esp32s3` crate
with shared `microfips-esp-common` for DNS, config, and stats.

**Build (WiFi):**
```bash
export $(grep -v '^#' .env | xargs) \
  && . /home/ubuntu/export-esp.sh && RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN=esp \
  cargo build -p microfips-esp32s3 --release --target xtensa-esp32s3-none-elf \
  -Zbuild-std=core,alloc
# Output: target/xtensa-esp32s3-none-elf/release/microfips-esp32s3
```

**Build (BLE L2CAP):**
```bash
. /home/ubuntu/export-esp.sh && RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN=esp \
  cargo build -p microfips-esp32s3 --release --target xtensa-esp32s3-none-elf \
  -Zbuild-std=core,alloc --features l2cap
# Output: target/xtensa-esp32s3-none-elf/release/microfips-esp32s3-l2cap
```

**IMPORTANT:** After any change to `keys.json` or identity code, MUST run
`cargo clean -p microfips-esp32s3` before rebuild to avoid stale compiled-in keys.

**Flash:**
```bash
# Detect S3 port (currently /dev/ttyACM1)
for p in /dev/ttyACM*; do vid=$(cat /sys/class/tty/$(basename $p)/device/../uevent 2>/dev/null | grep PRODUCT | cut -d= -f2); [ "$vid" = "303a/1001/101" ] && echo "S3 on $p"; done

# Flash WiFi variant
. /home/ubuntu/export-esp.sh && RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN=esp espflash flash -p /dev/ttyACM<N> --chip esp32s3 \
  target/xtensa-esp32s3-none-elf/release/microfips-esp32s3

# Flash L2CAP variant
. /home/ubuntu/export-esp.sh && RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN=esp espflash flash -p /dev/ttyACM<N> --chip esp32s3 \
  target/xtensa-esp32s3-none-elf/release/microfips-esp32s3-l2cap
```

**Serial port:** USB Serial JTAG (VID:PID `303a:1001`, `/dev/ttyACM*`), NOT CP210x.
Auto-reset works via DTR/RTS, no button pressing needed.
**Current mapping:** `/dev/ttyACM1` (detect at runtime — never hardcode).

**Monitor serial output:**
```bash
python3 -c "
import serial, time
s = serial.Serial('/dev/ttyACM1', 115200, timeout=2)
deadline = time.time() + 30
while time.time() < deadline:
    line = s.readline().decode(errors='replace').strip()
    if line: print(line, flush=True)
s.close()
"
```

**CRITICAL: Do NOT use `esptool --no-stub`** — it overwrites the partition table and bricks
the board. Always use `espflash`.

**Serial logging note:** `esp-println` on S3 outputs to UART0 (GPIO43/44) by default, NOT the
USB JTAG serial port (`/dev/ttyACM*`). To see logs through USB JTAG, add `"jtag-serial"` feature
to `esp-println` in `crates/microfips-esp32s3/Cargo.toml`:
```toml
esp-println = { version = "0.16.1", default-features = false, features = ["esp32s3", "jtag-serial"], optional = true }
```
Without `jtag-serial`, use `espflash flash --monitor` to see bootloader output only (no app logs).

**BLE status (2026-04-19):** S3 L2CAP firmware boots successfully with `esp-radio` BLE init,
advertises as peripheral, and connects to FIPS via central role. The 0-frame disconnect
(tie-breaker yield) and peripheral fallback both work correctly. FIPS must have a free BLE
connection slot — the Mac peer can occupy the slot and block S3 connections.

**TiLDAGON USB device mapping:** Serial `64:E8:33:72:01:24`, always verify with `lsusb` or
the detection script above. The M5 Stack (`0403:6001`, `/dev/ttyUSB0`) is a separate device.

**Recovery from bricked state:**
1. Hold boop (back button) while plugging USB
2. Hold for 3 seconds, then release
3. `espflash erase-flash --chip esp32s3`
4. `espflash flash --chip esp32s3` with the firmware binary

### ESP32 flash and monitor

Do NOT use probe-rs with ESP32. Use `espflash` from the Espressif toolchain.
If `espflash` fails to connect, kill stale processes holding the serial port first.

```bash
# Kill stale processes (e.g., leftover serial_tcp_proxy)
kill $(fuser /dev/ttyUSB0 2>/dev/null) 2>/dev/null
sleep 1

# Flash (primary)
. /home/ubuntu/export-esp.sh && RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN=esp espflash flash -p /dev/ttyUSB0 --chip esp32 target/xtensa-esp32-none-elf/release/microfips-esp32

# Flash (fallback if espflash fails — uses esptool v5.2.0, already installed)
esptool --chip esp32 --port /dev/ttyUSB0 --before default-reset -b 460800 write-flash 0x0 target/xtensa-esp32-none-elf/release/microfips-esp32

# Monitor (optional, after flash)
. /home/ubuntu/export-esp.sh && RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN=esp espflash monitor -p /dev/ttyUSB0 --chip esp32
```

 **ESP32 serial port:** CP210x USB-serial (VID:PID `10c4:ea60`), detect with the script above — do NOT hardcode `/dev/ttyUSB*`.
Always detect by VID:PID `10c4:ea60` (Silicon Labs CP210x):

```bash
for p in /dev/ttyUSB*; do
    vid=$(cat /sys/class/tty/$(basename $p)/device/../uevent 2>/dev/null | grep PRODUCT | cut -d= -f2)
    [ "$vid" = "10c4/ea60/100" ] && echo "ESP32 on $p"
done
```

## Testing

### Unit tests (no hardware)
```bash
cargo test -p microfips-core          # 234 tests: Noise, FMP, FSP, identity
cargo test -p microfips-core -- --nocapture  # verbose output
cargo test -p microfips-protocol --features std -- --test-threads=1  # 130 tests: framing, transport, node, ScriptedPeer
```

### Host-side VPS handshake test (no MCU)
```bash
cargo run -p microfips-link            # sends MSG1 to VPS via UDP, expects MSG2
```

### USB CDC echo test (hardware, no FIPS)
```bash
python3 -c "
import serial, struct, time
s = serial.Serial('/dev/ttyACM1', 115200, timeout=1)
for n in [1, 16, 63, 64, 100]:
    payload = bytes(range(n))
    s.write(struct.pack('<H', len(payload)) + payload)
    time.sleep(0.05)
    hdr = s.read(2)
    resp = s.read(struct.unpack('<H', hdr)[0])
    assert resp == payload, f'echo failed for {n}B'
    print(f'echo {n}B OK')
print('all pass')
"
```

### Bridge + MCU + VPS handshake test (hardware — simplified single-hop)

The `serial_udp_bridge.py` tool replaces the old 3-hop pipeline. No SSH tunnel or
VPS-side bridge needed — it sends UDP directly from the host to FIPS.

```bash
# STM32 (auto-detect by VID:PID, reset first)
st-flash --connect-under-reset reset
sleep 8  # wait for USB enumeration
python3 tools/serial_udp_bridge.py --serial /dev/ttyACM<N> --udp-host orangeclaw.dns4sats.xyz

# ESP32 (auto-detect by VID:PID)
kill $(fuser /dev/ttyUSB0 2>/dev/null) 2>/dev/null; sleep 1
python3 tools/serial_udp_bridge.py --serial /dev/ttyUSB0 --udp-host orangeclaw.dns4sats.xyz

# Both MCUs simultaneously (use different bind ports)
python3 tools/serial_udp_bridge.py --serial /dev/ttyACM<N> --bind-port 45679 &
python3 tools/serial_udp_bridge.py --serial /dev/ttyUSB0 --bind-port 45680 &
```

**Expected:** `>> CDC->UDP: frame#1 114B` (MSG1), `<< UDP->CDC: frame#1 69B` (MSG2),
then heartbeat frames every ~10s.

### Bridge + MCU + VPS handshake test (hardware — legacy 3-hop)

See `scripts/test_hw_handshake.sh` for the full automated procedure. The manual steps are:

```bash
# 0. CLEANUP — kill stale processes by PID (NOT pkill -f — kills test's own SSH)
# If you have saved PIDs from a previous run:
kill $PROXY_PID $TUNNEL_PID 2>/dev/null
fuser -k 45679/tcp 2>/dev/null  # local port cleanup
vssh 'pkill -f fips_bridge 2>/dev/null; echo $VPS_PASS | sudo -S fuser -k 45679/tcp 2>/dev/null'
vssh "echo $VPS_PASS | sudo -S systemctl restart fips"

# 1. Verify USB (after MCU reset + 7s enumeration wait)
lsusb | grep -E "c0de|0483"
# Find the MCU port (NOT ttyACM0 — that's ST-Link):
for p in /dev/ttyACM*; do
    prod=$(cat /sys/class/tty/$(basename $p)/device/../uevent 2>/dev/null | grep PRODUCT | cut -d= -f2)
    [ "$prod" = "c0de/cafe/10" ] && echo "MCU on $p"
done

# 2. Start serial TCP proxy on host
python3 tools/serial_tcp_proxy.py --serial /dev/ttyACM<N> --port 45679 &

# 3. SSH reverse tunnel: VPS:45679 → host:45679
sshpass -p "$VPS_PASS" ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -fN \
  -R 45679:127.0.0.1:45679 -o ServerAliveInterval=30 -o ExitOnForwardFailure=yes \
  $VPS_USER@$VPS_HOST

# 4. Upload and start bridge on VPS
vscp tools/fips_bridge.py :/tmp/fips_bridge.py
vssh 'nohup python3 /tmp/fips_bridge.py --tcp 127.0.0.1:45679 > /tmp/bridge_hw.log 2>&1 &'

# 5. Check results (after ~10s)
vssh 'cat /tmp/bridge_hw.log'
vssh "echo $VPS_PASS | sudo -S journalctl -u fips --no-pager -n 10 --since '1 min ago'"
```

**Expected in bridge log:** `CDC->UDP: frame#1 114B` (MSG1), `UDP->CDC: frame#1 69B` (MSG2)
**Expected in VPS journal:** `Connection promoted to active peer`, no `link dead timeout`
**Bridge has diagnostic alive logs:** `>> alive, buf=0B, frames=N, rx=NB` every 10s

### Bridge + ESP32 + VPS handshake test (hardware)

Manual steps for ESP32 (uses port 45680, VPS peer port 31338):

```bash
# 0. CLEANUP — kill stale processes
kill $PROXY_PID $TUNNEL_PID 2>/dev/null
fuser -k 45680/tcp 2>/dev/null
vssh 'pkill -f fips_bridge 2>/dev/null; echo $VPS_PASS | sudo -S fuser -k 45680/tcp 2>/dev/null'
vssh "echo $VPS_PASS | sudo -S systemctl restart fips"

# 1. Verify ESP32 serial port (CP210x, NOT ttyACM*)
for p in /dev/ttyUSB*; do
    vid=$(cat /sys/class/tty/$(basename $p)/device/../uevent 2>/dev/null | grep PRODUCT | cut -d= -f2)
    [ "$vid" = "10c4/ea60/100" ] && echo "ESP32 on $p"
done

# 2. Start serial TCP proxy on host
python3 tools/serial_tcp_proxy.py --serial /dev/ttyUSB0 --port 45680 &

# 3. SSH reverse tunnel: VPS:45680 → host:45680
sshpass -p "$VPS_PASS" ssh -o StrictHostKeyChecking=no -fN \
  -R 45680:127.0.0.1:45680 -o ServerAliveInterval=30 -o ExitOnForwardFailure=yes \
  $VPS_USER@$VPS_HOST

# 4. Upload and start bridge on VPS (ESP32 uses --local-port 31338)
vscp tools/fips_bridge.py :/tmp/fips_bridge.py
vssh 'nohup python3 /tmp/fips_bridge.py --tcp 127.0.0.1:45680 --local-port 31338 > /tmp/bridge_esp32.log 2>&1 &'

# 5. Check results (after ~10s)
vssh 'cat /tmp/bridge_esp32.log'
vssh "echo $VPS_PASS | sudo -S journalctl -u fips --no-pager -n 10 --since '1 min ago'"
```

**Note:** ESP32 does not use USB CDC, so there is no DTR-based `wait_connection()` blocking.
The proxy can be started at any time; the ESP32 immediately begins sending MSG1 once booted.

### BLE bridge + ESP32 + VPS handshake test (hardware)

Requires BLE firmware flashed and `bleak` installed (`pip install bleak`).

```bash
# 1. Flash BLE firmware (if not already)
kill $(fuser /dev/ttyUSB0 2>/dev/null) 2>/dev/null; sleep 1
. /home/ubuntu/export-esp.sh && RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN=esp espflash flash -p /dev/ttyUSB0 --chip esp32 target/xtensa-esp32-none-elf/release/microfips-esp32-ble

# 2. Verify BLE advertising (wait 8s after flash for boot)
sleep 8
python3 -c "
import asyncio
from bleak import BleakScanner
async def scan():
    devices = await BleakScanner.discover(timeout=10)
    found = [d for d in devices if d.name and 'microfips' in d.name.lower()]
    assert found, 'microfips-esp32 not found'
    print(f'Found: {found[0].name} ({found[0].address})')
asyncio.run(scan())
"

# 3. Start BLE bridge
python3 tools/ble_udp_bridge.py --ble-name "microfips-esp32" --udp-host orangeclaw.dns4sats.xyz --verbose &

# 4. Wait for handshake (~30s)
sleep 30

# 5. Check results
# Expected in bridge output: "BLE->UDP: frame#1" (MSG1), "UDP->BLE: frame#1" (MSG2)
# Check VPS: vssh "echo $VPS_PASS | sudo -S journalctl -u fips --no-pager -n 5 --since '1 min ago'"
```

**Note:** BLE bridge uses BlueZ D-Bus API, not the serial port. No DTR-based `wait_connection()`
blocking. The ESP32 advertises immediately on boot and the bridge connects within seconds.

### MCU-to-MCU FSP test (both MCUs required)

Both STM32 and ESP32 must be connected. The automated script handles setup, bridge startup, IK handshake waiting, and FSP frame detection. Supports `--flash` to build and flash both MCUs first.

```bash
# Full E2E test (build + flash + run)
bash scripts/test_mcu_to_mcu_fsp.sh --flash

# Run only (MCUs already flashed)
bash scripts/test_mcu_to_mcu_fsp.sh
```

**Expected:** FSP SessionSetup (148B) and SessionAck frames in bridge logs, heartbeat sustained for both MCUs.
See `.sisyphus/evidence/task-8-mcu-fsp-setup.txt` for reference output.

### PCAP Capture & Wireshark Analysis

FIPS traffic (UDP port 2121) can be captured with standard tools:

```sh
# Capture FIPS traffic
./tools/capture_fips.sh capture.pcap 100

# Analyze with tshark + Lua dissector
tshark -r capture.pcap -X lua_script:tools/fips_dissector.lua -V
tshark -r capture.pcap -X lua_script:tools/fips_dissector.lua -T fields -e fips.phase -e fips.payload_length
tshark -r capture.pcap -X lua_script:tools/fips_dissector.lua -Y 'fips.phase == 1'
```

A reference capture from a sim-to-sim FSP PING test is at `tools/reference.pcap`.
The dissector (`tools/fips_dissector.lua`) parses FMP prefix, MSG1, MSG2, and established frames.
Encrypted payloads are shown as opaque hex — no key material needed.

### Process management for hardware tests

**CRITICAL: Do NOT use `pkill -f` patterns.** They kill the current SSH session running
the test. Only use `kill $SPECIFIC_PID`. Use `disown` on background SSH sessions.

### Hardware testing procedure (CRITICAL — read before every hardware test)

**Pipeline startup order matters.** The MCU's `wait_connection()` blocks until a USB
serial port is opened with DTR asserted. If the proxy isn't running, the MCU sits in
`wait_connection()` forever and never sends MSG1.

**Correct order:**
1. Clean all stale processes (proxy, tunnel, bridge, FIPS restart)
2. Start serial TCP proxy (this opens the serial port → asserts DTR → MCU proceeds)
3. Start SSH reverse tunnel
4. Upload and start bridge on VPS
5. Wait for handshake results (MCU sends MSG1 ~0.5s after proxy opens port)

**WRONG order — do NOT do this:**
- Resetting MCU before proxy is running → MCU enters `wait_connection()`, no DTR, blocks
- Using `st-flash reset` while proxy/tunnel/bridge are active → kills USB, proxy gets
  `[Errno 5] Input/output error`, bridge gets BrokenPipe, cascade failure
- Starting pipeline, resetting MCU, then checking — USB re-enumerates on different
  ttyACM number, proxy holds stale fd

**Never use `st-flash reset` during a live test.** It halts the CPU via SWD, kills the
USB device, and the proxy/bridge lose their connections. Only reset BEFORE starting
the pipeline, or not at all (the MCU's `run()` loop handles retries automatically).

**MCU retry timing:** CONNECT_DELAY (500ms) + RECV_TIMEOUT (30s) + RETRY_SECS (3s) =
~33.5s per handshake cycle. If you miss MSG1, wait ~34s for the next attempt.

**Use the test script.** `scripts/test_hw_handshake.sh` handles cleanup, enumeration,
pipeline startup, and result checking in the correct order. Prefer it over manual setup.

**Bridge reconnect bug (known):** When one of the bridge's two threads dies (e.g.,
`serial_to_udp` gets BrokenPipe), the reconnect loop only triggers when BOTH threads
die. If only one dies, the bridge hangs. Workaround: kill and restart the entire bridge
process instead of relying on reconnect.

**probe-rs and USB coexistence:** `probe-rs read --connect-under-reset` halts the CPU
to read memory. This is safe for post-mortem debugging (CPU is in reset). But do NOT
attach probe-rs/RTT while USB CDC traffic is active — the periodic CPU halts break
USB transfers.

## LED State Machine

The STM32F469I-DISCO has 4 user LEDs for debug feedback (no debugger needed):

| LED | Pin | Color |
|-----|-----|-------|
| LD1 | PG6 | Green |
| LD2 | PD4 | Orange |
| LD3 | PD5 | Red |
| LD4 | PK3 | Blue |

| State | Green | Orange | Red | Blue | Meaning |
|-------|:-----:|:------:|:---:|:----:|---------|
| Boot | blink | off | off | off | Firmware running, crypto init |
| USB ready | on | off | off | off | `wait_connection()` resolved |
| Handshake | on | on | off | off | MSG1 sent, waiting MSG2 |
| ESTABLISHED | on | on | off | on | Handshake OK, entering steady |
| HB sent | on | on | off | flash | Heartbeat transmitted |
| HB received | on | on | on | on | Heartbeat received from peer |
| Error | off | off | on | off | Handshake failed |
| Disconnected | off | off | off | off | USB disconnected, retrying |

Post-mortem state can be read via `probe-rs read` with CPU in reset (not live):
```bash
probe-rs read --chip STM32F469NIHx --connect-under-reset b32 <STAT_STATE_addr> 1
# STAT_STATE values: 0=boot, 1=usb_ready, 2=msg1_sent, 3=handshake_ok, 4=hb_tx, 5=hb_rx, 6=err, 7=disconnected
```

### ESP32 LED State Machine

The ESP32 has a single user LED on GPIO2 (blue onboard LED). State visibility is
more limited than STM32's 4-LED display. Behavior is identical for UART, BLE, L2CAP, and WiFi transports.

### STM32F746 LED State Machine

The STM32F746G-DISCO has only 1 physical user LED on PI1 (Arduino D13).
The firmware assigns PI1 as green, with PI2/PI3/PG6 as orange/red/blue (no physical LEDs on those pins).
The state machine runs identically to F469 but only the green LED (PI1) is visible.

| State | GPIO2 (Blue) | Meaning |
|-------|:------------:|---------|
| Boot / Disconnected | off | Firmware running or USB disconnected |
| MSG1 sent (handshake in progress) | on | MSG1 sent, waiting MSG2 |
| Handshake OK (entering steady) | on | Handshake succeeded |
| HB sent / HB received | unchanged | Counter-only update, LED stays on |

States 4 (HB sent) and 5 (HB received) do not change the LED — only the atomic
counters are updated. This is because ESP32's steady-state loop runs in a single
`select()` branch (UART recv always wins over timer), and changing the LED in the
recv hot path adds latency with no visual benefit (the LED is already on from state 3).

## Debugging Best Practices

1. **Never read hardware registers while probe-rs has the CPU halted.** The state is
   undefined mid-transfer. Register captures under these conditions are artifacts,
   not evidence of firmware bugs.

2. **Use LED patterns for state visibility.** No debugger can be attached during USB
   traffic. The 4 LEDs encode the full state machine (see table above).

3. **Use atomic counters for post-mortem debugging.** `STAT_MSG1_TX`, `STAT_MSG2_RX`,
   `STAT_HB_TX`, `STAT_HB_RX`, `STAT_USB_ERR`, `STAT_STATE`, `STAT_RECV_PKT`,
   `STAT_RECV_FRAME` can be read after reset via probe-rs (not live — only in reset/halt).

4. **Isolate variables before escalating.** If USB fails, first test without probe-rs.
   Only blame firmware after eliminating external variables.

5. **Minimal, separated changes.** One concern per PR. Don't bundle cleanup, errata
   workarounds, and speculative recovery paths.

6. **Stale Cargo cache breaks critical-section**: If `cargo build` fails with
   `RawRestoreStateInner defined multiple times` in critical-section, run `cargo clean`
   before rebuilding. This is a Cargo feature unification cache issue, not a nightly
   or crate version incompatibility.

7. **BLE address type must match remote device.** When constructing a targeted BLE
   connect (e.g. trouble-host `Central::connect()` with `filter_accept_list`), the
   address kind (PUBLIC vs RANDOM) must match what the remote device actually advertises.
   `Address::random(bytes)` hardcodes `AddrKind::RANDOM` -- if the target has a PUBLIC
   address (check with `hciconfig hci0`), use `AddrKind::PUBLIC` explicitly. A mismatch
   causes silent connect failure. See issue #81.

8. **BLE disconnect settle delay.** After a BLE L2CAP disconnect, the HCI controller
   needs time to clean up before accepting a new connection. The firmware uses a
   500ms settle delay (`BLE_DISCONNECT_SETTLE_MS`) between disconnect and the next
   connect attempt. Reducing this risks "Connection Already Exists" errors from the
   controller.

## DANGER: Do NOT erase flash via probe-rs

```bash
# NEVER RUN THIS — corrupts STM32F469 flash/option bytes:
probe-rs erase --chip STM32F469NIHx --connect-under-reset
```

## DANGER: Do NOT manipulate USB sysfs paths directly

**Never run these commands:**
```bash
echo "1-6" > /sys/bus/usb/drivers/usb/unbind
echo "1-6" > /sys/bus/usb/drivers/usb/bind
```

Unbinding a CDC ACM device from the `usb` driver corrupts the kernel TTY layer.
`open(/dev/ttyACM*)` hangs at kernel level with no recovery except reboot.

**Recovery (in order of preference):**
1. Rebind unbound PCI controller
2. PCI-level reset
3. Physical USB cable disconnect/reconnect
4. Host reboot

**Safe USB reset:** `st-flash --connect-under-reset reset` (goes through SWD, not USB bus).

### USB recovery via uhubctl (IMPORTANT)

When ST-Link USB gets stuck (LIBUSB_ERROR_PIPE after repeated SWD operations):

```bash
sudo uhubctl -l 1 -a cycle -f -d 5 -r 2
```

- `-r 2` (repeat=2) is the key — some devices need two off cycles to actually power down
- After cycle, wait 8-10s for full re-enumeration
- Check with `lsusb | grep "0483"` AND the VID:PID detection loop — sometimes `lsusb` shows device but sysfs is broken from earlier `usb1 remove`
- **Do NOT use `echo 1 > /sys/bus/usb/devices/usb1/remove`** — corrupts USB device tree, `lsusb` stops working even though devices are present

## Known Pins

### STM32F469

| Peripheral | Pins | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|

### STM32F746G-DISCO

Separate build target (`--features board-f746`). Same firmware crate, same protocol stack.
USB OTG FS and RNG peripherals are register-compatible. FIPS handshake + heartbeat hardware-verified 2026-05-04.
Runs at 216 MHz (vs 168 MHz on F469). Only 1 physical user LED on this board.

| Peripheral | Pins | Notes |
|------------|------|-------|
| USB OTG FS | PA11 (DM), PA12 (DP) | Register-compatible with F469 |
| LED green | PI1 | Arduino D13, only user LED on this board |
| LED orange | PI2 | Arduino D8, no physical LED |

| ST-Link | SWD on PA13/PA14 | |
| Clock | 216 MHz sys, 48 MHz USB | HSI/8 * 216 /2 = 216 MHz, /9 = 48 MHz |

### ESP32-D0WD

|------------|------|-------|
| UART TX | GPIO1 | Connected to CP210x RX |
| UART RX | GPIO3 | Connected to CP210x TX |

## Clock Config

### STM32F469

Default (no display):
```
HSI (16 MHz) → PLL → 168 MHz sysclk
                   → 48 MHz USB (PLL_Q, Clk48sel)
                   → 42 MHz APB1
                   → 84 MHz APB2
```

With `--features display` (uses BSP `config_168()` preset):
```
HSE (8 MHz oscillator) → PLL → 168 MHz sysclk
                               → 48 MHz USB (PLL_Q, Clk48sel)
                        → PLLSAI → 54.86 MHz LTDC pixel clock (PLLSAI_R)
```

The "HSE bypass hangs" warning applies to `HseMode::Bypass`, NOT `HseMode::Oscillator`.
The board has an 8 MHz crystal — `HseMode::Oscillator` works fine (proven in gm65-scanner, micronuts).

Note: DCKCFGR2 does NOT exist on STM32F469 (Amperstrand/embassy-stm32f469i-disco#27).
embassy writes CK48MSEL to DCKCFGR, which is correct for this MCU. No DCKCFGR2 workaround needed.

### STM32F746

```
HSI (16 MHz) → PLL → 216 MHz sysclk
                   → 48 MHz USB (PLL_Q, Clk48sel)
                   → 54 MHz APB1
                   → 108 MHz APB2
```

HSE is 25 MHz on F746G-DISCO but firmware uses HSI for consistency with F469.

### ESP32-D0WD

ESP32 uses internal PLL from 40 MHz crystal. Clock config is handled by esp-hal.
No manual clock configuration needed — `esp_hal::init()` sets up 240 MHz CPU clock.

## USB Serial Port

The MCU appears as a CDC ACM device with VID:PID `c0de:cafe`. The ttyACM number varies
— it is NOT always ttyACM1 (ttyACM0 is usually ST-Link). Always detect by VID/PID:

```bash
for p in /dev/ttyACM*; do
    prod=$(cat /sys/class/tty/$(basename $p)/device/../uevent 2>/dev/null | grep PRODUCT | cut -d= -f2)
    [ "$prod" = "c0de/cafe/10" ] && echo "MCU on $p"
done
```

## ESP32 Serial Ports (D0WD + S3)

**WARNING: tty numbers are NOT stable.** USB enumeration order changes across reboots, cable replugs, and hub power cycles. A device that was `ttyUSB1` may appear as `ttyUSB0` next boot. **Always detect by VID:PID, never hardcode tty numbers.** An M5 Stack (FTDI FT232, VID:PID `0403:6001`) is also connected and appears as `/dev/ttyUSB*` — do not flash or open that device.

Two ESP32 devices are connected simultaneously, plus an M5 Stack on FTDI. All three appear as `/dev/ttyUSB*`. **Never assume a fixed tty number** — always detect by VID/PID.

### ESP32-D0WD (CP210x UART)

VID:PID `10c4:ea60`, appears as `/dev/ttyUSB*`:

```bash
for p in /dev/ttyUSB*; do
    vid=$(cat /sys/class/tty/$(basename $p)/device/../uevent 2>/dev/null | grep PRODUCT | cut -d= -f2)
    [ "$vid" = "10c4/ea60/100" ] && echo "ESP32-D0WD on $p"
done

### ESP32-S3 TiLDAGON (USB Serial JTAG)

VID:PID `303a:1001`, appears as `/dev/ttyACM*` (NOT ttyUSB). Uses Espressif USB JTAG/serial, NOT CP210x:

```bash
for p in /dev/ttyACM*; do
    vid=$(cat /sys/class/tty/$(basename $p)/device/../uevent 2>/dev/null | grep PRODUCT | cut -d= -f2)
    [ "$vid" = "303a/1001/101" ] && echo "ESP32-S3 on $p"
done
```

**IMPORTANT:** The S3's `/dev/ttyACM*` port is distinct from the STM32's ST-Link (`0483:374b`) and the MCU CDC (`c0de:cafe`). All three appear as ttyACM — always match by VID/PID.

### Quick detection script (all devices)

```bash
echo "=== STM32 ST-Link ==="
for p in /dev/ttyACM*; do vid=$(cat /sys/class/tty/$(basename $p)/device/../uevent 2>/dev/null | grep PRODUCT | cut -d= -f2); [ "$vid" = "483/374b/100" ] && echo "  ST-Link on $p"; done
echo "=== STM32 MCU (c0de:cafe) ==="
for p in /dev/ttyACM*; do prod=$(cat /sys/class/tty/$(basename $p)/device/../uevent 2>/dev/null | grep PRODUCT | cut -d= -f2); [ "$prod" = "c0de/cafe/10" ] && echo "  MCU on $p"; done
echo "=== ESP32-D0WD (CP210x) ==="
for p in /dev/ttyUSB*; do vid=$(cat /sys/class/tty/$(basename $p)/device/../uevent 2>/dev/null | grep PRODUCT | cut -d= -f2); [ "$vid" = "10c4/ea60/100" ] && echo "  D0WD on $p"; done
echo "=== ESP32-S3 (USB JTAG) ==="

```

### Environment variables for CI key override

All host tools accept `FIPS_NSEC` (64 hex chars) to override the identity secret key.
`FIPS_PEER_NPUB` (66 hex chars) overrides the peer's public key (used by `fips-handshake` and `microfips-sim`).
`FIPS_SECRET` and `FIPS_PEER_PUB` are accepted as deprecated fallbacks (with a warning printed to stderr).
When not set, tools panic — no default device identity is allowed.

## BLE Address Type Pitfall (Issue #81)

When constructing a targeted BLE connect (e.g. trouble-host `Central::connect()` with
`filter_accept_list`), the address kind (PUBLIC vs RANDOM) must match what the remote
device actually advertises. A mismatch causes silent connect failure.

- ESP32-D0WD and ESP32-S3 both use random static BLE addresses (`USE_PUBLIC_BLE_ADDRESS = false`)
- The FIPS Linux daemon has a PUBLIC address on hci0
- Current code uses `AddrKind::PUBLIC` in the filter_accept_list for FIPS — correct
- FIPS (commit 9c6507e) uses `resolve_addr_type()` to dynamically detect remote address type
- **NEVER use `Address::random(bytes)` for the FIPS target** — it hardcodes `AddrKind::RANDOM`

## Upstream FIPS Compatibility

**Upstream FIPS source:** `/home/ubuntu/src/fips` (NOT `/home/ubuntu/src2/fips.rm` which is stale/abandoned).
Use `/home/ubuntu/src/fips` for any FIPS source code reference, diff, or API lookup.

### Current State (as of 2026-05-02)

- **FIPS master** has merged macOS BLE (bluest crate) and Windows ports
- **`ble-transport-reliability`** branch (based on master at `cbc7809`) adds: Linux drain task with adaptive rate limiting, macOS BLE transport, GATT PSM re-discovery on reconnect, BLE config validation, TCP window clamping for BLE-tunneled TCP. **Wire protocol unchanged** — ESP32 needs no changes.
- **`linux-ble-stability-v2`** branch (our previous test branch) has been superseded by `ble-transport-reliability`. All leaf-proxy and BLE framing fixes are now in the newer branch.
- **`next` branch** (0.4.0-dev, jmcorgan/next) contains breaking changes: Noise IK/XK → XX, FMP v0 → v1, version negotiation, profile negotiation
- microfips needs to **rebase off latest master** before next development cycle

### FIPS `ble-transport-reliability` Branch (audited 2026-05-02)

23 commits since branch-off from master. Key changes relevant to microfips:

**No wire protocol changes.** All changes are Linux/macOS daemon-side implementation details transparent to an ESP32 L2CAP peer.

**Linux drain task architecture:**
- Each BLE connection has a background drain task that mediates all rate-limited sends
- `send()` enqueues to a 32-slot channel, drain task applies rate limiting before L2CAP write
- `send_urgent()` bypasses drain queue — used for MSG2 handshake responses and rekey MSG2
- Rate limiter uses BBR-inspired AIMD: 15–80 Kbps, RTT <200ms → probe up, RTT >500ms → drain down
- ESP32 observation: inbound frame timing is spaced by rate limiter, no backpressure signaling
- **ESP32 doesn't need drain/pacer** — it writes directly to BLE at controller speed

**macOS BLE transport:**
- New `io_macos.rs` using bluest (central) and CoreBluetooth (peripheral)
- Identical wire protocol to Linux: same PSM (0x0085), MTU (2048), framing (2-byte BE length prefix), pubkey exchange format
- ESP32 works with both macOS and Linux FIPS daemons without modification

**GATT PSM re-discovery (Linux + macOS):**
- Retries GATT PSM characteristic read after 200ms on first failure
- macOS: uses `discover_services_with_uuid()` to bypass stale cache
- ESP32 impact: none — ESP32 advertises PSM, doesn't discover it

**BLE config validation:**
- `BleConfig::validate()` resets invalid fields to defaults instead of erroring
- Defaults: PSM=0x0085, MTU=2048, max_connections=7, connect_timeout=10s, send_burst=2048
- ESP32 impact: none — ESP32 uses compile-time constants

**Key FIPS BLE constants:**
| Constant | Value | Purpose |
|----------|-------|---------|
| `BLE_LINUX_QUEUE_DEPTH` | 32 | Drain queue capacity (frames) |
| `BLE_SEND_TIMEOUT` | 15s | L2CAP write timeout |
| `MIN_RATE_BPS` | 15,000 | Minimum send rate (AIMD) |
| `MAX_RATE_BPS` | 80,000 | Maximum send rate (AIMD) |
| `RTT_LOW_MS` | 200 | Uncongested threshold |
| `RTT_HIGH_MS` | 500 | Congested threshold |
| `PUBKEY_EXCHANGE_TIMEOUT_SECS` | 5 | Pubkey exchange timeout |

**Pubkey exchange format (verified compatible):**
- FIPS sends 34 bytes raw through `BleStream`, which adds 2-byte BE length prefix on the wire
- microfips sends 36 bytes (2B prefix + 34B payload) matching the same format
- Both sides agree: `[0x00][32B x-only pubkey][1B capabilities]` (34B payload)
- `BluerStream::recv()` strips the 2-byte prefix before passing to `pubkey_exchange()`

### Noise Protocol Design Choices

FIPS implements Noise directly (not via a spec-compliant Noise library), following only the
cryptographic primitives and ordering from the Noise spec. Custom payloads (startup epoch,
capability flags, negotiation) are attached to handshake messages. Same approach as Lightning Network.

Confirmed by FIPS maintainer (2026-04-11): these are deliberate design choices, not bugs.

| # | Choice | Description | Rationale |
|---|--------|-------------|-----------|
| D1 | Empty AAD during handshake | `AEAD_ENCRYPT(k, n, b"", plaintext)` instead of passing `h` as AAD | Custom Noise implementation with own payloads; transport keys bind via `ck` |
| D2 | IK `se` token ordering | Initiator computes `DH(e,rs)` not `DH(s,re)` | Part of custom IK. Eliminated in 0.4.0-dev by switching to Noise XX. |
| D3 | x-only ECDH | `SHA256(x_coordinate)` instead of raw ECDH shared secret | Required for Nostr npub compatibility. Same technique as BIP-340. |

microfips matches all three for interoperability. Golden vectors (FIPS issue #1) validate cross-implementation compatibility.

### ESPHome Integration

FIPS has a `leaf_proxies` config feature that supports ESPHome devices via identity derivation:
`SHA256("esphome:fips_ble:" + identity_seed)` → secp256k1 keypair. This is a FIPS-side TCP
proxy pattern, not a standalone ESPHome component. microfips takes a different approach: direct
BLE L2CAP from ESP32 to FIPS, implementing the FIPS protocol stack natively. Both can coexist.

### Upcoming Breaking Changes (0.4.0-dev)

When the `next` branch ships, microfips will need:

1. **Noise XX migration** — rewrite `microfips-core/src/noise.rs` for 3-message XX handshake (both link and session layers)
2. **FMP v1 wire format** — new msg3 header, version negotiation payload
3. **Version negotiation** — min/max version range, 64-bit feature bitfield, TLV extensions
4. **Profile negotiation** — new concept, requirements TBD
5. **Golden vector regeneration** — XX handshake vectors needed for validation
